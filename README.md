  M I T
Fast multipurpose bot with cool commands, stable music and cool features to offer. <3 Let's get started with Galaxy so you have a great time with her.

## Step one: Checking the ping
Before using Galaxy, it is our highest priority for fast ping, you have to check the ping by `&ping` if the ping is more than 1000 ms that means your shard is down (or dead) to fix this simply re-add Galaxy, you can check info bye `&shardinfo` to know your shard type `&stats`

## Step two: Mod commands
No roles should be setted up, as a matter of fact, Galaxy will *detect* your perms. If you do not have the perms galaxy will **not** reply.

## Step three: Setting up farewell message & greet **[OPTIONAL]**
To set up a greet channel go to the desired channel and type `&greet`, for greet-messages type [EXAMPLE: `&greetmessage Welcome $user to $server`]. To set up a farewell channel go to the desired channel and type `&farewell`, to set up farewell-messages type in [EXAMPLE: `&farewellmessage Bye $user`]

## Step four: Setting up a modlog channel
Simply go to the desired channel and type `&modlog` which will enable modlog toggle.



# 👍 You have now setted up Galaxy, try `&cmds`
