#Kosh Systems

Thank you for using Kosh Systems!
Created by RedstoneClaw101 and Lil Curly,
Kosh Systems provides moderation and fun for 
your Discord server.

#Configuration

These are important and must be completed
for the bot to work in your server.
To recieve these instructions on Discord,
type ;setup in DM's with the bot.

1) Ping

To check the bots Ping, simply run ;ping. If the bot is offline, we are updating it. If the bot is online but does not respond try reinviting it. If this does not work, join the support server at the end of this page.


2) Roles and Permissions

To give your admins bot admin, you will need the following roles:

MOD - For server mods

ADMIN - For server admins

OWNER - For server owners

Everyone with the @everyone role will get fun commands and music access.


3) Join/ Leave Messages [OPTIONAL]

To set up a custom join channel, run ;join in the desired channel.
To set up a custom leave channel, run ;leave in the desired channel.

Once that is done we need to configure the message.
For join, run ;joinmessage (message here)

EXAMPLE: ;joinmessage Welcome $user to $server. 

For leave, run ;leavemessage (message here)

EXAMPLE: ;leavemessage Bye $user

4) Loggin Channel

Simply go to the channel you want to show mod logs and run ;modlogs

#Finishing Up
